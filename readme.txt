This program simulates light diffraction through slits. The interface was designed using JavaFX Scene Builder. The interface allows the user to change the wavelength, number of slits, separation between slits, slit width, and distance to a screen. It validates user input and adjusts visualizations based on input. In addition, the program also allows the user to export the visualizations. 

Diffraction.jar is the executable for this program.
